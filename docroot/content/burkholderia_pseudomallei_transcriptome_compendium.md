Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp), the causative agent of the often-deadly infectious disease melioidosis, contains one of the largest prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, at 7.2 Mb with two large circular chromosomes (1 and 2). To comprehensively delineate the Bp transcriptome, we integrated whole-genome tiling array expression data from Bp exposed to >80 diverse physical, chemical, and biological conditions. Our results provide direct experimental support for the strand-specific expression of 5467 Sanger protein-coding genes, 1041 operons, and 766 non-coding RNAs. A large proportion of these transcripts displayed condition-dependent expression, consistent with them playing functional roles. The two Bp chromosomes exhibited dramatically different transcriptional landscapes – Chr 1 genes were highly and constitutively expressed, while Chr 2 genes exhibited mosaic expression where distinct subsets were expressed in a strongly condition-dependent manner. We identified dozens of cis-regulatory motifs associated with specific condition-dependent expression programs, and used the condition compendium to elucidate key biological processes associated with two complex pathogen phenotypes – quorum sensing and in vivo infection. Our results demonstrate the utility of a Bp condition-compendium as a community resource for biological discovery. Moreover, the observation that specific in vitro cues exist that can activate significant portions of the Bp virulence machinery provides insights into Bp’s ability to act as an “accidental pathogen”, where genetic pathways used by the bacterium to survive in environmental niches may have contributed to its ability to colonize human hosts.

The expression data is available in [PATRIC](https://www.patricbrc.org/view/ExperimentComparison/1191081) and at [GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43205).  Important sets of genes identified include:

* [Quorum sensing (pmlI) regulated proteins (genes significantly differentially expressed, 562 up-regulated and 625 down-regulated, between quorum sensing mutants and wild-type Bp](http://enews.patricbrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Quorum-sensing-pmlI-regulated-proteins.xlsx)
* [Network-predicted heat-shocked proteins (genes from the maximum relatedness of clusters network analysis, from clusters C131 and C265)](http://enews.patricbrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Network-predicted-heat-shocked-proteins.xlsx)
