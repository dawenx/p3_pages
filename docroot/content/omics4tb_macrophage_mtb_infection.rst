Omics4TB: MiR-155-regulated molecular network orchestrates cell fate in the innate and adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
==============================================================================================================================================

The regulation of host-pathogen interactions during Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains unresolved. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
important regulators of the immune system, and so we used a systems
biology approach to construct an miRNA regulatory network activated in
macrophages during Mtb infection. Our network comprises 77 putative
miRNAs that are associated with temporal gene expression signatures in
macrophages early after Mtb infection. In this study, we demonstrate a
dual role for one of these regulators, miR-155. On the one hand, miR-155
maintains the survival of Mtb-infected macrophages, thereby providing a
niche favoring bacterial replication; on the other hand, miR-155
promotes the survival and function of Mtb-specific T cells, enabling an
effective adaptive immune response. MiR-155-induced cell survival is
mediated through the SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1
(SHIP1)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Thus, dual regulation of the
same cell survival pathway in innate and adaptive immune cells leads to
vastly different outcomes with respect to bacterial containment.

|                                   | still not well understood. Using  |
|                                   | a systems biology approach, we    |
|                                   | demonstrate here that miR-155 is  |
|                                   | one of several microRNAs that     |
|                                   | regulate host gene expression     |
|                                   | over the first 48 hours of Mtb    |
|                                   | infection in macrophages. miR-155 |
|                                   | regulates the cell survival of    |
|                                   | Mtb-infected macrophages through  |

|                                   | timecourse gene expression data,  |
|                                   | we constructed a miRNA regulatory |
|                                   | network for the innate immune     |
|                                   | response to Mtb infection by WT   |
|                                   | macrophages. The network          |
|                                   | suggested a role for seven miRNAs |
|                                   | in regulating the host response   |
|                                   | to Mtb, with miR-155 being one of |
|                                   | them. We then validated a role    |
|                                   | for miR-155 by comparing the      |
|                                   | response between WT and           |
