Driving Biology Projects (DBPs) are two-year awards that focus on infectious diseases research related to human bacterial pathogens. Research includes the use of high-throughput experimental technologies (HTP) to functionally characterize the genome, proteome or metabolome of bacterial organisms and/or host-pathogen interactions. This research may help elucidate the role of genes, proteins and metabolites with respect to pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance or other biological processes of interest. The data and information generated by the DBPs will be made accessible to the broad scientific community and will be used to drive PATRICâ€™s infrastructure development to enable other researchers to perform similar analyses at the PATRIC website using their own data.

The DBP proposals were independently reviewed and evaluated by the [PATRIC Scientific Working Group](https://www.patricbrc.org/content/SWG) (SWG), and the top two proposals were selected for award for each funding period.  The awarded DBPs are:
