# PATRIC Collaborations

The opportunity to collaborate on various projects enables the team to understand and drive important capabilities into the PATRIC resource as well as the addition of important collections of data. Included in these efforts are:

## Burkholderia Transcription data

Collaboration with Patrick Tan [tanbop@gis.a-star.edu.sg](mailto:tanbop@gis.a-star.edu.sg) at the [Genome Institute of Singapore](www.gis.a-star.edu.sg). See the data at [PATRIC](https://www.patricbrc.org/view/ExperimentComparison/1191081). For more information on this project, please read [*Burkholderia pseudomallei* Trancriptome Compendium Project](https://www.patricbrc.org/content/burkholderia_pseudomallei_transcriptome_compendium).

## USDA Genome Sequencing Projects

* Surveillance data for Brucella in the Greater Yellowstone Area, USA. These genomes were sequenced by USDA and subsequently assembled and annotated by PATRIC using RAST. View or download all 148 genomes [here](https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/234#view_tab=genomes&filter=keyword(USDA) available exclusively at PATRIC.
* [270 *Mycobacterium bovis* genomes](https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/1763#view_tab=genomes&filter=and(keyword(USDA),keyword(2013-09-01))) are available exclusively at PATRIC. These genomes were sequenced by USDA and, subsequently, assembled and annotated by PATRIC using RAST.
