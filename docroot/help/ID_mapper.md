# ID Mapper

## Overview
The ID Mapping Tool allows users to quickly map PATRIC identifiers to those from other prominent external databases, such as GenBank, RefSeq, EMBL, UniProt, KEGG, etc. Alternatively, users can start with a list of external database identifiers and map them to the corresponding PATRIC features.

## PATRIC Feature Strategy

This tool uses the Uniprot-KB mapping table to map external IDs to
PATRIC. This is done using NCBI IDs. Due to updates over time some NCBI
IDs may achieve better mapping results than others.
